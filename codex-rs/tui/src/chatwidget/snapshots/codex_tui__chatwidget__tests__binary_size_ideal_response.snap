• I need to check the codex-rs repository to explain why the project's binaries
  are large. The user is likely seeking specifics about the setup: are Rust
  builds static, what features are enabled, and is debug information included?
  It could be due to static linking, included OpenSSL, or how panic handling
  is set up. I should look into the Cargo.toml file to confirm features and
  profiles without needing to edit any code. Let's get started on this!

• I’m going to scan the workspace and Cargo manifests to see build profiles and
  dependencies that impact binary size. Then I’ll summarize the main causes.

• I'm reviewing the workspace's release profile, which has settings like
  lto=fat, strip=symbols, and codegen-units=1 to reduce binary size. However, it
  seems that "strip = symbols" only removes symbols, not debug information. In
  Rust 1.73+, both "symbols" and "debuginfo" stripping options are available. I
  should check whether using these results in a smaller binary. I’ll also skim
  through crates for heavy dependencies in Cargo.toml, including cli, core,
  exec, linux-sandbox, tui, login, ollama, and mcp.

• I’m evaluating how binary size is influenced by various factors. There are
  many binaries, such as codex and codex-exec, which include dependencies by
  default, pulling in features like Tokio and hyper. For instance, reqwest
  includes default features like TLS through rustls. If default features remain
  enabled, it inflates the size with many additional components. I notice
  that for musl targets, using vendored builds of OpenSSL could significantly
  increase binary size. This is quite the intricate web of dependencies!

  Analyzing musl and binary size

  I’m considering the implications of building for musl with static linking.
  In this case, OpenSSL might come into play through some crates, but reqwest
  defaults to using rustls, although openssl-sys vendored could increase
  binary size. It’s interesting to think about whether they’re targeting musl,
  especially since it seems they might often be building for Mac and Linux with
  dynamic linking instead.

  I also realize there’s a difference between debug and release builds — release
  should be smaller due to optimizations, but if they’re defaulting to debug
  builds, that could lead to much larger binaries.

  Assessing crate impacts on size

  I need to be precise when analyzing binary sizes from various crates. Some
  crates, like ratatui-image, include heavy features such as libjpeg decoders,
  which can really bulk things up. Then there are the tree-sitter crates that
  contain large static grammar tables, adding significant size. The starlark
  crate and tracing-subscriber also contribute to size increases.

  With static linking per binary being standard in Rust, it leads to multiple
  copies of the same dependencies unless cdylibs are used. That makes the
  compile times longer, but using LTO helps reduce bloat somewhat through
  deduplication.

  Evaluating binary size factors

  Having multiple binaries indeed increases the overall size significantly.
  I'm considering options like upgrading to "opt-level = 'z'" or using
  "strip=debuginfo" for reducing size. It's interesting that while the profile
  only sets symbols for stripping, not debuginfo, this could inflate sizes if
  retained in release builds.

  The distinction between "symbols" and "debuginfo" is critical; "symbols"
  keeps debug information which may not align with the goal of minimizing
  size. I’d like to verify with the Rust documentation, but my network access
  is restricted.

  Explaining large binary sizes

  I’m analyzing why binaries in this project are so large. The primary reasons
  include monolithic static linking, where each binary includes the full
  dependency graph without shared libraries. Heavy dependencies such as reqwest,
  hyper, and TLS components also contribute significantly to size, along with
  image decoders and other libraries.

  Using MUSL targets means vendored OpenSSL can drastically increase the
  size due to static linking. Furthermore, if the release profile keeps debug
  information due to using "strip = symbols," that can lead to larger binaries
  as well. It’s a mix of several factors, including panic strategies and
  platform-specific linking behavior.

  Identifying binary size contributors

  I’m considering why binaries are still large even without static linking. The
  tracing-subscriber crate potentially adds weight because it includes regex,
  though it can sometimes use a lighter version. References from files like
  "core/Cargo.toml" show dependencies like reqwest and tokio, while the tui uses
  the image crate.

  To present this clearly, I’ll format the final answer with two main sections:
  "Main Causes" and "Build-Mode Notes." I can also include brief suggestions for
  reducing size, but I want to stay focused on answering the user's question.

─ Worked for 0s ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Here’s what’s driving size in this workspace’s binaries.

  Main Causes

  - Static linking style: Each bin (codex, codex-tui, codex-exec, codex-mcp-
  server, etc.) statically links its full dependency graph, so common code isn’t
  shared at runtime across executables.
  - Heavy deps (HTTP/TLS): reqwest brings in Hyper, HTTP/2, compressors,
  and a TLS stack (rustls by default; OpenSSL on musl). In core, login, tui,
  and ollama you enable reqwest with json/stream, which still pulls a large
  transitive set.
  - Image/terminal stack: codex-tui includes image (with jpeg), ratatui,
  crossterm, and ratatui-image, which together contribute significant code size
  (decoders, pixel ops, terminal backends).
  - Parsers/VMs: tree-sitter + tree-sitter-bash (in core and apply-patch) and
  starlark (in execpolicy) include sizeable parser/VM tables and runtimes.
  - Tokio runtime: Broad tokio features (rt-multi-thread, macros, process,
  signal) across many crates inflate code size even if only subsets are used
  per bin.
  - Panic + backtraces: Default panic = unwind and backtrace support keep
  unwinding tables and symbols that add weight.
  - Per-target OpenSSL (musl): For *-unknown-linux-musl, core enables openssl-
  sys with vendored, compiling OpenSSL into the binary—this adds multiple
  megabytes per executable.

  Build-Mode Notes

  - Release settings: You use lto = "fat" and codegen-units = 1 (good for size),
  but strip = "symbols" keeps debuginfo. Debuginfo is often the largest single
  contributor; if you build in release with that setting, binaries can still
  be large.
  - Debug builds: cargo build (dev profile) includes full debuginfo, no LTO, and
  assertions—outputs are much larger than cargo build --release.

  If you want, I can outline targeted trims (e.g., strip = "debuginfo", opt-
  level = "z", panic abort, tighter tokio/reqwest features) and estimate impact
  per binary.
